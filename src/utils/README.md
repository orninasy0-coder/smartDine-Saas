# Utils Directory

This directory contains shared utility functions used across the application.

## Structure

```
utils/
├── validation/       # Form and data validation
├── formatting/       # Date, currency, text formatting
├── constants/        # Application constants
├── helpers/          # General helper functions
└── types/            # Shared TypeScript types
```

## Guidelines

- Keep utilities pure functions when possible
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Include unit tests for complex utilities
